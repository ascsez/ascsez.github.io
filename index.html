								<p style="text-align: justify;"> Hi, I am Aashish Gopali-a curious mind with a deep passion for learning new things, especially when it comes to computers and airplanes. Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by how systems work, whether it’s the logic behind a line of code or the mechanics that keep a jet in the sky.
									Take a look at my <a href="#work">work and projects</a>.</p>
								<p>I hold a bahelors degree in Computer Science and have gained hands-on experience in software development, data analysis, and identity access management. I'm always eager to dive into new technologies, build meaningful projects, and collaborate with others to solve real-world problems. For me, the joy of learning is just as exciting as building something that works.

									Outside of work, you’ll probably find me geeking out over aviation tech or exploring the latest trends in programming and data science. I’m enthusiastic, adaptable, and constantly driven by the question: "What can I discover next?"</p>
